== Preconfigured action types

You can preconfigure an action type to have all the information it needs prior to startup
by excluding this action type from `xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes` and adding all its connectors to the `kibana.yml` file.
How to preconfigure connectors is described with details <<pre-configured-connectors, here>>.

Preconfigured action types offer the following capabilities:

- Require no setup. Configuration and credentials needed to execute an
action are predefined.
- Has only <<pre-configured-connectors, preconfigured connectors>>.
- Connectors cannot be edited or deleted.

=== Example of a preconfigured action type

The following example shows a valid configuration of preconfigured action type with 1 out-of-the box connector.

[source,console]
------------------------
  xpack.actions.enabledActionTypes: ['.slack', '.email', '.index'] <1>
  xpack.actions.preconfigured:                                     <2>
    - id: 'my-server-log'
      actionTypeId: .server-log
      name: 'Server log #xyz'
------------------------

<1> `enabledActionTypes` should exclude preconfigured action type to prevent creating and deleting connectors.
<2> `preconfigured` is the setting for defining the list of available connectors for the preconfigured action type.

=== Managing preconfigured action types

Preconfigured action type connectors appear in the connector list, regardless of which space the user is in.
They are tagged as “preconfigured” and cannot be deleted.

Clicking on a Create connector button shows the select menu with the list of available action types. 
But preconfigured action types shouldn't be in the select menu, because creating regular connector is not allowed.
