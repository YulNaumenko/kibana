== Alert types

{kib} supplies alert types in two ways: some are built into {kib} (these are known as stack alerts), while domain-specific alert types are registered by {kib} apps.

=== Standard stack alert types

This section covers stack alerts.
Users will need `all` access to the *Stack Alerts* feature to be able to create and edit any of the alerts listed below.
See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information on configuring roles that provide access to this feature. 

Currently {kib} provides two stack alerts: <<alert-type-index-threshold>> and <<alert-type-es-query>>.

=== Domain-specific alert types

For domain-specific alert types, refer to the documentation for that app.
Currently we the next alerts grouped by the application:

* <<create-alerts, Observability alerts>>
* <<prebuilt-rules, Security alerts>>
* <<geo-alerting, Maps alerts>>
* <<xpack-ml, ML alerts>>
