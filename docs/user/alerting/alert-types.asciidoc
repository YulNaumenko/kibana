== Alert types

{kib} supplies alert types in two ways: some are built into {kib} (these are known as stack alerts), while domain-specific alert types are registered by {kib} apps.

==== Standard stack alerts

Users require the `all` privilege to access to the *Stack Alerts* feature and create and edit alerts. .
See <<kibana-feature-privileges, feature privileges>> for more information. 

{kib} provides two stack alerts: 

* <<alert-type-index-threshold>>
* <<alert-type-es-query>>


[float]
==== Domain-specific alerts

For domain-specific alerts, refer to the documentation for that app.
{kib} supports these alerts:

* {observability-guide}/create-alerts.html[Observability alerts]
* {security-guide}/prebuilt-rules.html[Security alerts]
* <<geo-alerting, Maps alerts>>
* <<xpack-ml, ML alerts>>
