:frontmatter-description: Add a connector that can send requests to {inference}.
:frontmatter-tags-products: [kibana] 
:frontmatter-tags-content-type: [how-to] 
:frontmatter-tags-user-goals: [configure]


The {inference} connector uses {es} client to send requests to {inference}. The connector uses the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> to send the request.

[[define-inference-ui]]
=== Create connectors in {kib}

You can create connectors in *{stack-manage-app} > {connectors-ui}*.  For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/inference-connector.png[{inference} connector]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

[float]
[[inference-connector-configuration]]
==== Connector configuration

{inference} connectors have the following configuration properties:

Name::      The name of the connector.
Service::   The {inference} supported provider service.
Task type:: The {inference} task type, it depends to the selected service.
Inference ID:: The {inference} ID.
Provider configuration:: Settings for service configuration.
Provider secrets:: Configuration for authentication.
Task type configuration:: Settings for task type configuration.

=== Test connectors

You can test connectors with the <<execute-connector-api,run connector API>> or
as you're creating or editing the connector in {kib}. For example:

[role="screenshot"]
image::management/connectors/images/inference-completion-params.png[{inference} params test]
// NOTE: This is an autogenerated screenshot. Do not edit it directly.

The {inference} actions have the following configuration properties. Properties depends to the selected task type.

[float]
[[inference-connector-perform-completion]]
=== Connector perform completion task

The following example performs a completion on the example question.
Input::      The text on which you want to perform the inference task. For example:
+
[source,text]
--

{
  input: 'What is Elastic?'
}
--

[float]
[[inference-connector-perform-text-embedding]]
=== Connector perform text embedding

The following example performs text embedding.
Input::      The text on which you want to perform the inference task. For example:
+
[source,text]
--

{
  input: 'The sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel.',
  task_settings: {
    input_type: 'ingest
  }
}
--
Input type::      An optional string that overwrites the connector's default model.

[float]
[[inference-connector-perform-rerank]]
=== Connector perform rerank task

The following example performs reranking on the example input.
Input::      The text on which you want to perform the inference task. Should be a string array. For example:
+
[source,text]
--

{
  input: ['luke', 'like', 'leia', 'chewy', 'r2d2', 'star', 'wars'],
  query: 'star wars main character'
}
--
Query::      The search query text.

[float]
[[inference-connector-perform-sparse-embedding]]
=== Connector perform sparse embedding task

The following example performs sparse embedding on the example sentence.
Input::      The text on which you want to perform the inference task. For example:
+
[source,text]
--

{
  input: 'The sky above the port was the color of television tuned to a dead channel.'
}
--

[float]
[[inference-connector-networking-configuration]]
=== Connector networking configuration

Use the <<action-settings, Action configuration settings>> to customize connector networking configurations, such as proxies, certificates, or TLS settings. You can set configurations that apply to all your connectors or use `xpack.actions.customHostSettings` to set per-host configurations.
